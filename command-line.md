command line is a tool used to interact with a computer or server (remote computer you are connected to). With it you can navigate through the storage system of the computer, create, delete and edit files (objects in the computer system that contain information) and directories (folders in the computer that hold files and other directories) and more generally tell the system what to do (commands)

Command line use involves only reading and entering text into a window.

Here are some Command Line commands.
